Corporate Social Responsibility

Corporate Social Responsibility (concerns 2 and 3 in Data types)
Firms are a nexus of contracts, given the context, principal(s) and agent(s) varies. In the spirit of
free society, one would still argue corporate social responsibility is detrimental to firm’s primary
objective which is to maximize shareholders’ wealth yet there is an over-arching indulgence of
firms to commit in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities and communication. A major
contemporary cornerstone of CSR is arguably the UN Global Compact – launched in 2000 is
perhaps the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative with more than 9500 participating
firms from 164 countries as of 2018. The reporting aspect of the initiative is the Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI).
The GRI database centrally collected all data points presented in the GRI’s Sustainability
Disclosures while firms can also register reports for free in the repository. The database holds report
from 1999 to 2017. The population available for you is roughly 19000 CSR or Sustainability reports
from across the globe for various industries and company sizes.
Since different sectors have different stakeholders’ firms usually cater to the needs of the
stakeholders it perceives most important and that is how the CSR reporting is usually tailored.
There is, however, debate on level of the importance of a particular stakeholder across the various
sectors. Nonetheless, regulators have identified that the four areas (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions,
diversity, employee health & safety, and customer welfare) are of significance importance for most
of these sectors. Regulators are bestowed with the responsibilities of regulating firm behaviour so
that they behave responsibly, ethically, to the least: legally, and work towards creating a more
sustainable world. The regulators are thus now interested to know how different firms are
addressing these four key issues of CSR, how has it developed over the years, the level of attention
given to the different areas over different point of time and are there any conformity or variation
across firm size, country of reporting, and sectoral affiliation when addressing these issues.
The data was collected as a part of a research project in Microdata analysis on sustainability
reporting and has been used in multiple manuscripts by multiple doctoral students for their doctoral
theses. The data CANNOT BE REDISTRIBUTED without proper permission and authorization.
Task for Text data of the CSR reports
Your task here is to do some basic text analytics and provide the regulators with some
meaningful interpretation of these reports with regard to these issues or any other issue that
you find interesting.
